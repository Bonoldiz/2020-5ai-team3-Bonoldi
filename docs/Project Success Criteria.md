# Project Success Criteria - Team 3 - PCTO Manager

## *the Project Manager project will be considered a success if...*

The project will be considered a success if (1) the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the first school period with read only  access to the data, and (2) the team members will be motivated as at the begin of the project.

The project will be considered done when all our testes will sign as passed and no more issues will rise.

### UPDATE (10/04/2020)

The project is considered finished (due to issues with time and team) and done partially.

1. **1** Overview
  1. **1.1**** Purpose and Scope**

Team 3 has been developing a web application in order to help students to easily manage their PCTO experience reports and teachers to associate people with the right companies. The software aims to ease the process of association between the student and the company, which right now is really difficult and long for everyone.

The project is designed for the students of the school, their responsible teachers and the responsible of the whole school&#39;s PCTO system. This means it will manage the school&#39;s internal associations, updating an internal database and Spaggiari&#39;s one at the same time.

The user interface will be intuitive and simple to navigate. A user guide and system

administration manual will be provided.

1.
  1. **1.2**** Goals and Objectives**

The general objective of this project is to create a web application that manages the students&#39; PCTO activities in a simple but effective way.

Project Goals:

1. Create a web application that is useful and looks good.
2. Give the school a web application that best meets the needs of students when looking for a company
3. Give the PCTO manager a web application to easily manage relations between students and companies.
4. Learn about software engineerin

Project Objectives:

1. Create a web application that functions in a simple and intuitive manner.
2. Provide students with the companies with their respective requirements and characteristics, to decide where to go to carry out the PCTO activity.

1.
  1. **4.2**** Configuration Management Plan**

The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work products:

1. All project work products will be stored in a decentralized GitHub repository.
2. All baselined documents will have a Document Control section with a change history to track initialization and subsequent changes.
3. Items that are subject to change control will be considered baselined after a group review at the end of the initial document creation.
4. Once a product is baselined:

(1) anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends a message to the rest of the teamdescribing the change, reason for the change, expected schedule impact, and time line for integrating the change.

(2) if no one responds to the group within a short time with a reason for why the change request shouldn&#39;t be permitted, it will be considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.

1. (3)if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their opinion.
2. (4)if a change takes place, the initiator must collaborate with the project manager to update the schedule.

1. **5**** Supporting Process Plans**
  1. **5.1**** Risk Management Plan**

| **Rank** | **Risk** | **Probability of Loss** | **Size of Loss** | **Risk Exposure** | **Response** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Schedule / time line delivery | Likely | Minor | Low | Mitigate: Stick to the schedule. |
| 2 | Learning curve for new tools and technologies longer than expected | Unlikely | Moderate | Moderate | Buy Information: Begin working on a basic prototype early to test out fundamental programming concepts &amp; knowledge |
| 4 | Data feed not available from Spaggiari or SIGMA | Unlikely | Major | Low | Avoid: Be sure to be able to access Spaggiari and SIGMA databases via different working methods |

1.
  1. **5.2**** Te ****st**  **Plan**

The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing, and a schedule detailing the tasks, owners, and time line.

These tests will be agreed with each teacher individually.

1.
  1. **5.3**** Product Acceptance Plan**

At the conclusion of each iteration, the prototype created will be tested by the customer(s) to ensure it meets the requirements of that iteration.

For the final iteration, product acceptance testing will ensure that the prototype functions as expected with a user&#39;s data.
